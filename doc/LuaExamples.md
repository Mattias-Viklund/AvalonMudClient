# Avalon Mud Client

## Lua Examples

Lua examples are currently provided via GitHub gists.  A `.lua` file generally has the lua syntax in a format that is easy to read.  A `json` file contains all of the pieces needed for a Lua script that can be imported into the Avalon Mud Client.  The `.json` package should provide you a one step setup so that the functionality you need just works after import.  A `.json` package can contain alias, trigger, direction and variable information (everything that might be required to run a lua script).

Note: Packages aren't just limited to Lua, they can be used to share in game directions, simple alises and triggers and the future additional information such as crowd sourced world data.
