# Avalon Mud Client

## Mud Color Codes (in Lopes format)

The following are the client supported color codes that can be used when you invoke commands like #echo which allow you to echo content to any terminal.  These should allow you to mix and match to color inserted text as you desire.

## Color Code Table

### Historical Note

Lopes color was common snippit found in many Diku/Merc/Rom derivative muds and exists to this day in many code bases.  As a nod to those who came before us I decided to use the same format for the color codes.
