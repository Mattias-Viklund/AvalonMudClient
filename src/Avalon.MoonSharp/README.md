# Avalon.MoonSharp

Lua Support for the Avalon Mud Client.

- This is a .NET 6 port of the Moonsharp library (which can be used with UWP as well as .NET 6).
- This is an unofficial release.  Substantial changes have been made and code that was not required for the Avalon Mud Client was removed including memory optimizations that removed portions of the debugging features.  If those are required this fork might not be a good choice for you.
- License is inherited from the official Moonsharp project.

### Project Description

An interpreter for the Lua language, written entirely in C# for the .NET.
