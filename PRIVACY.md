# Avalon Mud Client Privacy Policy

Avalon Mud Client does not collect or any user's personally identifiable information.  This application only makes direct connections to the game hosts you specify - we do not store, re-transmit, or proxy any personal information from your PC or device, nor any information transferred between you and any game host.

That being said, we cannot control third-party game hosts that you may connect to, nor any network infrastructure between you and the host. Each third-party host may have its own individual privacy policy associated with that game host. Please contact the administrator for any host you connect to to obtain their privacy policy.

In addition, remember that no matter what the privacy policy is for any given game, the connection itself is sent over the internet in unencrypted and unsigned clear text - therefore any information transmitted to or received from any host may be viewed/stored/retransmitted by third parties controlling the internet infrastructure between you and the host, such as your ISP, or by third parties on your WiFi or LAN, depending on network hardware configuration.
